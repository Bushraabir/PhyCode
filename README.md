## üåü What is PhyCode?

PhyCode is an innovative LeetCode-style platform that fuses **Physics concepts** with **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problem-solving. Whether you're a student, developer, or physics enthusiast, PhyCode helps you:

- **Build Logic**: Sharpen your problem-solving skills by applying physics principles to coding challenges.
- **Code Forces**: Tackle problems inspired by real-world physics simulations, forces, and dynamics.
- **Simulate Reality**: Use code to model physical phenomena, from projectile motion to quantum mechanics.

Perfect for preparing for coding interviews, learning physics through code, or just having fun with interdisciplinary challenges!

## üî• Why PhyCode? (Features)

- **Physics-Infused Problems**: Solve DSA problems with a twist ‚Äì incorporate gravity, momentum, waves, and more!
- **Interactive Simulations**: Visualize your solutions with built-in physics engines (coming soon).
- **Difficulty Levels**: From beginner (Newton's Laws) to advanced (Relativity and Quantum Computing).
- **Community Contributions**: Submit your own physics-DSA problems and solutions.
- **Leaderboard & Progress Tracking**: Compete with others and track your coding journey.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Code in Python, JavaScript, C++, and more.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Get started in minutes!

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Bushraabir/PhyCode.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd PhyCode
   ```
3. Install dependencies (assuming Node.js or Python backend ‚Äì customize based on your stack):
   ```
   npm install  # For JavaScript-based setup
   # OR
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # For Python-based setup
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```
   npm start  # or python app.py
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Sign Up/Login**: Create an account to save your progress.
2. **Browse Problems**: Filter by physics topic (e.g., Mechanics, Electromagnetism) or DSA category (e.g., Graphs, Dynamic Programming).
3. **Solve & Submit**: Write your code in the integrated editor and test against physics-based test cases.
4. **Simulate**: See your code come to life with visual simulations.

Example Problem: *Projectile Motion Path* ‚Äì Use arrays and loops to simulate a ball's trajectory under gravity.

```python
# Sample Solution
def projectile_motion(v0, theta, g=9.8):
    import math
    trajectory = []
    t = 0
    while True:
        x = v0 * math.cos(theta) * t
        y = v0 * math.sin(theta) * t - 0.5 * g * t**2
        if y < 0:
            break
        trajectory.append((x, y))
        t += 0.1
    return trajectory
```
